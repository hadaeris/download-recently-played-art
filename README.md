# download-recently-played-art

A script to download recently played artwork from spotify on a regular interval.

run_no_authentication.py does not need fancy Spotify privileges and can be used with a generic last.fm token instead.
It is also far messier than run.py as it was used more as a testing playground.

Used in conjunction with MagicMirror modules.
